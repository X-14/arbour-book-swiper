# Deploy to Render - Instructions

## Your changes have been pushed to GitHub! ✅

Repository: https://github.com/X-14/arbour-book-swiper

## Option 1: Auto-Deploy (If Enabled)

If you have auto-deploy enabled on Render:
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your "arbour-book-swiper" service
3. It should automatically start deploying
4. Wait for the build to complete (usually 5-10 minutes)
5. Check the logs to ensure no errors

## Option 2: Manual Deploy

If auto-deploy is NOT enabled:
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your "arbour-book-swiper" service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for the build to complete
5. Check the logs

## Important: Model Training on Render

**CRITICAL**: The AI model needs to be trained on Render!

After deployment completes, you need to run the training script once:

### Method 1: Using Render Shell (Recommended)
1. In your Render dashboard, go to your service
2. Click on "Shell" tab
3. Run: `python train_model.py`
4. Wait for completion (should see "Model training complete")

### Method 2: Add to Build Command
Alternatively, you can add model training to your build command in render.yaml:

```yaml
buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt && python train_model.py
```

This will train the model every time you deploy (slower but automatic).

## Verify Deployment

Once deployed and model is trained:
1. Visit your Render URL (e.g., https://arbour-book-swiper.onrender.com)
2. Login/Signup
3. Set preferences (3 genres)
4. Check that books are sorted by compatibility
5. Test editing preferences from dashboard
6. Verify swiping works with preference-based recommendations

## Troubleshooting

If you see errors:
- Check Render logs for error messages
- Ensure FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON environment variable is set
- Verify the model files were created (check for models/ directory)
- Make sure all dependencies in requirements.txt are installed

## Environment Variables Needed

Make sure these are set in Render:
- `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` - Your Firebase service account key (as JSON string)

That's it! 🚀
